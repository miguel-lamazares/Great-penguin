# Auto-gif ðŸ¤–

`Auto-gif` is a simple solution for a problem that may not even exist, created to make my README more personalized. The central gif changes automatically, randomly selecting from a set of pre-chosen files.

## How to use ðŸ› 

<a href="/auto-gif/">Click here to download the files</a>.

1. Download the `update-gif.py` file.

After downloading, place it in the same directory as your `README.md` file.

2. Set up the workflow.

Download the `update-gif.yml` file and put it in the `.github/workflows` folder. If the folder doesn't exist, create it.

3. Add your GIFs

Create a folder named `gif` in the same directory as your `README.md` and `update-gif.py`. Add your favorite GIFs to this folder (it's recommended to number them, e.g., `1.gif`, `2.gif`, etc.).
